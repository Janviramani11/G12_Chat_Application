## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

### ‚öõÔ∏è Atomic Design Pattern

Our component hierarchy follows the atomic design methodology, which is inspired by chemistry's hierarchical organization of matter. This approach helps in creating a consistent, reusable, and scalable design system:

- atoms/: The smallest, indivisible UI components. These are the basic building blocks of our interface.  
  Examples: buttons, input fields, icons, labels.

- molecules/: Simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.  
  Examples: search bars (combining input and button atoms), menu items (combining icon and text atoms).

- organisms/: Complex UI components composed of molecules and/or atoms. These form distinct sections of the interface.  
  Examples: headers, forms, chat message bubbles.

The atomic design pattern allows for:

- Reusability: Atoms and molecules can be reused across different organisms and screens.
- Consistency: By using the same atoms throughout, we maintain a consistent look and feel.
- Scalability: New components can be easily created by combining existing atoms and molecules.

### üõ†Ô∏è Application Architecture

The application follows a modified MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

#### üóÇÔ∏è Model (Data Layer)

- data/: Contains data models and schemas
- domain/: Business logic and domain-specific rules
- firebase/: Firebase configuration and services for real-time data and authentication

#### üé® View (Presentation Layer)

- components/: UI components following atomic design (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- screens/: Full application screens/pages
- globalStyles.js: Global styling configurations

#### üß† Controller (Logic Layer)

- api/: API configurations and network requests
- helper/: Utility functions and helpers
- navigations/: Navigation logic and routing

## üîÑ Data Flow

1. _User Interaction_

   - User interacts with components (atoms/molecules/organisms)
   - Actions are triggered from the UI components
   - For Enhanced Query Suggestions, the user taps the "Enhance" button to get refined suggestions.

2. _Action Processing_

   - Helper functions process data when needed
   - API calls are made if required

3. _Data Management_

   - Firebase handles real-time data and authentication
   - Domain logic processes business rules

4. _UI Updates_
   - Components receive updated data through props or local state
   - Screen components render updated UI
   - Navigation updates if required

## ‚ú® Key Features

- _Atomic Design_: Modular and reusable component architecture
- _Real-time Updates_: Firebase integration for live data
- _Navigation_: Structured routing system
- _API Integration_: Organized API communication
- _Enhanced Query Suggestion_: A feature where users can tap the "Enhance" button while typing, allowing the system to generate refined suggestions (e.g., "happy birthday" ‚Üí "Wishing you a very joyous birthday filled with laughter and cheer").

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Components are organized by complexity (atoms ‚Üí molecules ‚Üí organisms)
- Business logic is separated from UI components
- API calls are isolated in the api directory
- Helper functions are modularized for reusability

This architecture ensures a scalable, maintainable, and organized codebase while following modern development practices and patterns.
